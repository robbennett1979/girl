# Project Exercises

# Exercise 1
# Let's create a mortgage calculator to figure out the monthly payments for a fixed rate loan.
# We will have inputs for the following:
# loan_amount = Total amount of the loan
# rate = Interest rate of the loan to be entered as number for percentage (ex 5.25% would be entered as .0525)
# term = Term of the loan, entered in months (360 months = 30 year loan)
# We will have output for the following:
# monthly_payment = Monthly Payment

# Here is the calculation in Python for figuring out monthly payment
# monthly_payment = (rate/12) * (1/(1-(1+rate/12)**(-term)))*loan_amount

# NOTES: Validate input, display monthly payment in USD with $ and two decimal places. It might be nice to
# allow user to enter rate as 5.75 but would have to account for this in the calculation or what is
# passed into the calculation




# Exercise 2
# Lets create a grocery shopping list. We should have item and quantity in the list and be able to add
# multiple items to the list. Once the user states that they are done adding items to the list,
# we should then print the list for the user. Quantity should be validated for int or whole numbers
