Python PEP8 Style Guidelines
https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

Imports
    According to the Python PEP8 style guidelines, imports should usually be on separate lines. You should only be
    importing what you need. Don't import an entire package if you only need part of it.

    Correct
        import os
        import sys
        from subprocess import PIPE

    Incorrect
        import sys, os

    Import only what is needed (if only math -> pi is needed, only import that)

        Incorrect
        import math

        Correct
        from math import pi

Variables
    A variable is a named location that is used to store assigned data into memory. A variable can have about
    anything assigned to it. The value or object that is assigned to a variable can be changed and manipulated
    as needed within an application or script. Typically the best naming convention is lower case one word or if
    multiple words, the words are separated by an underscore. Ex  my_variable

Constants
    A constant is a type of variable where the value can't be changed. Typically the best naming convention is all upper case one word or if
    multiple words, the words are separated by an underscore. Ex MY_CONSTANT

Functions
    A function is a block of code that is for a single specific purpose. Typically the best naming convention is
    lower case one word or if multiple words, the words are separated by an underscore. Ex  my_function
Classes
    A class can be looked at like an object. It can have both properties and methods. Typically the best naming convention is
    capital first letter and rest is lower case. Ex MyClass

Maximum Line Length
    It is recommended in PEP8 that all lines are limited to 79 characters in length. This will help in understanding and readability as the
    logic and code becomes more complex.

# Naming Conventions for constants and variables
# lowercase
# lowercase_underscores
# UPPERCASE
# UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORES
# CamelCase - Pascal Case, upper camel case  NOTE: Microsoft recognizes as Pascal Case
# camelCase - dromedary case, lower camel case  NOTE: Microsoft recognizes as camel case
